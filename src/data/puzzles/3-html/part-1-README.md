Today is HTML day and the cohort is absolutely jumping with excitement, that is until Stephen makes a slack post at `8:30:01 am` "Every body has some morning reading to be getting on with". It is suspected that some students haven't been ready to go at 8:30 sharp so the staff log into the LMS to check the times the students opened the notes, the times are collected as a list (your input), these lists have been grouped by mentor group and displayed quite appropriately as HTML. Your job is to sum the total time wasted by all students across the cohort.

Example input:

```md
<ul>
  <li>5</li>
  <li>8</li>
  <li>5</li>
  <li>4</li>
  <li>9</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>10</li>
  <li>3</li>
  <li>32</li>
</ul>
```

In this example there are 5 people in the first mentee group with total of `31` time wasted and 3 in the second with a total of `45` so overall students have wasted `76` time

Given the full input how much time was wasted in total?
