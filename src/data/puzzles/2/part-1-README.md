Intro week is half complete, today is `Kata` afternoon, time for some solo learning. A chance to practice your problem solving skills. The first kata for students of this cohort is about `triangle numbers`. Given a string of numbers (your input) the goal is to find the nth triangle number for each digit and sum them together.

Example input:

```md
352
```

From this input the result would be the total of the 3rd triangle number `(6)` the 5th `(15)` and the second `(3)` for a total of `24`

Given the full input what is the total of all the nth triangle numbers?
