First day at Northcoders, not everyone has there camera on, you decide to count hoe many people have there camera you set up your view so everyone in the call can be seen on one screen (your input).


Example input:

```
#..#..
...#..
.###..
...###
#####.
.##..#
```


People with their cameras on are represented by `#` and people with camera off are represented by `.`
In this example there are `17` people with there cameras on.

Given the full input, how many people have their cameras on?
