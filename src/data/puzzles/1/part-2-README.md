Just as you finish up counting your seminar lead `Lee` comes into the call and makes it clear it is expected of people to have their cameras on. Not everybody turns theres on but some do, people decide to turn theirs on based on whether they are located next to someone on the screen that has theres on (to the left or right), this all happens in an instance.

Example input:

```
#..#..
...#..
.###..
...###
#####.
.##..#
```

Now given this same example and the directive from Lee, the screen looks like

```
#####.
..###.
#####.
..####
######
######
```

Now 29 people have their cameras on.

Given the full input how many people have their cameras on now?
