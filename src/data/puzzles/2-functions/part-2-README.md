It turns out someone (Mark) had forgot to push the changes to the kata repo and there was a mistake with this question, it should have read, find the nth triangle number for the input, meaning the input is 1 long number.

With the same example input:

```md
352
```

The result would be the 352nd triangle number `62128`

Given the late change to the question what is the actual solution?
